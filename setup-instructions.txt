This is purely tested on linux machines, it is not developed with windows in mind. However you might be able to run it, we don't know.

(Creating a virtual environment is optional, but it makes the installation of modules be contained. If you are comfortable with python and pip, feel free to do it the way you prefer)

Create a virtual environment for this python project, at the folder this document is residing in, type this in your terminal type:

python -m venv venv

Now activate it, (again in your terminal) like this:

. venv/bin/activate

Then install the requirements, like this:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You are now ready to test our framework. Keep in mind that the virtualenv needs to be activated in the terminal you're running the scripts from
